# Digital Monsters

Alright, let's get this out of the way. This post is purely an excuse to gush about Digimon. Maybe one day I'll do a similar challenge and post about my top tv shows or anime. Digimon will definitely be on that list.

Honestly, this franchise was my first introduction to the idea of fanbases hating each other. Pokémon and Digimon were not friends; they were conmpetitors. Except, they really didn't need to be. Honestly, both franchises were great. But unfortunetly, Pokémon was popular; Digimon was...*well, not*. I remember passionately defending Digimon to my friends, but they just wanted nothing to do with it. Well, except for my best friend who was just as into it as I was.

So, what's the deal with Digimon? Well, the short answer is that it's a unique take on the upcoming internet age where the "digital world" has given rise to "digital monsters," or "Digimon" for short. Unlike in Pokémon, these creatures do not live in harmony with mankind; rather, they live in their own world. Some games and stories have the two worlds coexisting while others have them barely aware of each other. Unlike Pokémon, Digimon tends to focus on a single partner Digimon. In fact, *Digimon World* only allowed you to have one Digimon at a time. Unfortunately, this...didn't make for a great game. With *Digimon World 2*, the amount of Digimon you could expanded greatly, and you could even fight with three of them at a time! Is *Digimon World 2* a hidden gem of a game? Nah, not really. But it is fun if you like Digimon and definitely reinforced my love of JRPGs.

Honestly, this will likely be my shortest post. As I'm typing
