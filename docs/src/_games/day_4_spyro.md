# We Should Go on Vacation!

|*Spyro 2 - Ripto's Rage! OST: Gateway to Glimmer Forest*|

It's weird to think back and realize that Spyro's second adventure started out with him wanting a vacation after his last adventure. In the grand scheme of things, it's a strange way to start out a sequel, but this was the 90s. Video games wouldn't start taking themselves too seriously until about about another decade. Actually, now that I think about it, a prior protagonist engaging in wacky antics on a planned vacation trip is a bit of trope. Looking at you *Super Mario Sunshine*. Trope or not, it's a perfect way to setup a brand environment for Spyro to run, fly, and breathe fire through!

This is going to be one of the more difficult entries in this challenge. Make no mistake, *Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage* **is** an important game to me. However, *I haven't played this game in nearly 20+ years.* Talk about a major drawback to the daily upload formula. Well, while I regret not being able to form a fresh opinion on the game, I can still recall my fondness of the game in my head.

## Collectable Goodness

Another weird thought: it's only recently that we've coined the term "collect-a-thons" to describe most 3D-platform games. To us kids, these were just...*video games.* If anything, they were the purest form of a game. It was weird when a game wasn't a giant sandbox arena filled with hidden collectable goodies. And while some kids had their *Super Mario 64*s and others their *Banjo-Kazooie*s...mine was Spyro the Dragon.
