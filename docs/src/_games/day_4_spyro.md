# We Should Go on Vacation!

|*Spyro 2 - Ripto's Rage! OST: Gateway to Glimmer Forest*|

It's weird to think back and realize that Spyro's second adventure started out with him wanting a vacation after his last adventure. In the grand scheme of things, it's a strange way to start out a sequel, but this was the 90s. Video games wouldn't start taking themselves too seriously until about about another decade. Actually, now that I think about it, a prior protagonist engaging in wacky antics on a planned vacation trip is a bit of trope. Looking at you *Super Mario Sunshine*. Trope or not, it's a perfect way to setup a brand environment for Spyro to run, fly, and breathe fire through!

This is going to be one of the more difficult entries in this challenge. Make no mistake, *Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage* **is** an important game to me. However, *I haven't played this game in nearly 20+ years.* Talk about a major drawback to the daily upload formula. Well, while I regret not being able to form a fresh opinion on the game, I can still recall my fondness of the game in my head.

## Collectable Goodness

Another weird thought: it's only recently that we've coined the term "collect-a-thons" to describe most 3D-platform games. To us kids, these were just...*video games.* If anything, they were the purest form of a game. It was weird when a game wasn't a giant sandbox arena filled with hidden collectable goodies. And while some kids had their *Super Mario 64*s and others their *Banjo-Kazooie*s...mine was Spyro the Dragon.

To be clear, this is the second Spyro game. I owned both the original and the sequel, and while the first game *is* definitely important to me, the sequel won me over and to this day is my go-to Spyro game. There's something just fun and comforting about constantly going to a new area, collecting everything there, and then moving on to the next. Obviously, the challenge comes in *finding* each hidden goody, and man, some of them are hidden very well!

## Bring it on, Shorty!

Spyro, as a character, is pretty comparable to Sonic. He *feels 90s*. But unlike Sonic, Spyro unfortunately (...or maybe fortunately) fell off after his initial games. Sony had successfully used both him and Crash to market the Playstation as a rival to both Nintendo and Sega, but unlike the other two, Sony had no love for the characters beyond their market value. Crash would eventually be replaced by *Jak and Daxter* and Spyro would meet his end to *Ratchet and Clank*. While yes, the two of them still received games, they weren't the proud children of their parent company anymore. 

Honestly, I like Spyro. The short-fused, witty dialogue fits a dragon more than a hedgehog. The true crime is that Spyro never got that chance to be taken seriously. Some would argue that Sonic games took themselves *too seriously*, and while that's debatable, Spyro never even received that chance. Maybe for some, that's part of the charm, but I for one would have liked to see what an expanded world and lore for Spyro could look like. *No, not like Skylanders*. I would have liked to see Spyro more fleshed out and realized beyond the "90s kid with attitude."

Once again, this may be the hardest post I've made yet; I wish I had the chance to fully replay this. Regardless, this game was still an important piece of my childhood gaming career, and not including it would feel like a crime.
