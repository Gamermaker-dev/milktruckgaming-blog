# Welcome to my blog!

Welcome to MilkTruckThoughts! The blog for "MilkTruckMark" (aka Gamermaker in some circles).

Before you dive into the content here, please take a moment to read about myself and what content you will find here.

## Who am I?

My internet persona is MilkTruckMark! I'm a small-time streamer who enjoys video games, anime, Jesus, and programming!
I have an adorable puppy named Sonnie.
My favorite season is Fall, and my favorite holiday is Christmas.
In my freetime, I'm usually playing some form of video game; you might even catch me [streaming them](https://twitch.tv/MilkTruckGaming)!

That's...that's about it. I'm not super interesting. This blog is not about me.
This blog is about the things I love, which are infinitely more interesting.

## What do I love?

**Jesus, of course!** (Sorry, force of habit.)

As mentioned above, here you'll find posts about [video games](/games), [anime](/anime), [Jesus](/devotions), or [programming](/projects).
There may be more; I'll likely write whatever comes to mind.

So, how important are my opinions?
**Very.**


*Just kidding.*



I have professional experience with programming; I've been a software developer for over 4+ years with experience on multiple projects.
I've been playing video games since birth. (Literally, there's *baby pictures* of me playing Sonic the Hedgehog.)
I've been watching anime for at least 10+ years at this point.
And while I have no formal training, I've been studying Biblical scripture for years.

"But Mark," you might be saying. "I don't want to read about games/anime/Jesus (how dare you...*kidding, again.*)/programming!"

That's totally fine! This blog will be completely sectionalized!
You never have to view any posts about things you don't care about!

## Why did I make this blog?

I've been wanting to do this for awhile now.
I've made overly long social media posts for as long as I've been online.
Instead of annoying my friends and family with my drawn out posts, I figured it would better to have them inside a blog!

Plus, making a blog feels like a **must** for young programmers.

Big shoutout to Vue and Vuepress for making this extremely easy. Extra big shoutout to [z3by](https://github.com/z3by/vuepress-theme-modern-blog) for the theme.
I've taken it and modified it a bit for my liking, but they definitely did most of the heavy-lifting.

## Is this post almost over?

**Yes.**

Hope you enjoy your time here, and I hope maybe, maybe just I can write something to inspire you!

Let's enjoy this journey together, dear reader.
